# PWC-Power-BI-Job-Simulation

**Projects pursued during my Job Simulation**
During the course of the Jpb Simulation I created learned how to create insightful Dashboards using Power BI for different situations.
My biggest take-away from this simulation was understanding what could be key factors and how to showcase them in the best possible way.
